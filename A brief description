The data for this project comes from a clinical trial comprising persons with cystic fibrosis. These patients are subject to
an accumulation of mucus in the lungs which leads pulmonary exacerbation and lung deterioration.

The goal of this project is to evaluate the efficiency of daily administration of a recombination of human enzyme DNase 1 on 321
patients. The placebo group contains 324 individuals.

1. Data exploration
2. Checking if the data has been randomized (Kolmogorov test) 
3. Non-parametric estimation of the survival functions and testing difference in risk.
4. Simultanious hypothesis testing of treatment effect on people with different levels of health.
5. Confidence intervals for survival functions.
6. Fitting accelerated failure model and testing to see if the model is adequate with analysis of residuals
7. Regression using Cox model
